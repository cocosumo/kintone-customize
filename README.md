# DEPRECATED

DON'T USE THIS FOR NEW KINTONE CUSTOMIZATIONS.
CREATE NEW REPOSITORY FOR EACH APP CUSTOMIZATION INSTEAD.

Some customizations here are deprecated. 
Please create new repository for each app customization instead.

- NodeJS 16^
- Install packages for root, and for each packages.
- When depency error appears while installing packages, follow instructions in the console. 
eg. 

```
use npm i --legacy-peer-deps.
```

It can be resolved by updating related packages, but creating a new repository is more recommended.
This is due to observed short life cycle of kintone customization that defeats the benefits of monorepo.
